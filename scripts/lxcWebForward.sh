## This is a work in progress to forward ports using iptables
## I would also like to add removing the rules

#### Need to find a way to determine the interface I want to use as well as the IP of the machines in question

## sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlp59s0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.0.3.159
## sudo iptables -t nat -L --line-numbers
## it will most likely be rule 1
## iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING [line-number]
