# Scripts

These are some html, css or js and bash files I either wrote or edited to suit my needs better than the original had.

* [ConnectvsDisconnects.py](ConnectvsDisconnects.py) - This is a simple python scripts that shows the number of connections and disconnections for Cisco ASA devices.

* [backgroundchanger.sh](backgroundchanger.sh) - This was written as I couldnt get gnome or kde to properly change my background as I had too many files in the folder I was using (somewhere near 3000 images) and I wanted to randomize it regularly

* [backupCisco.sh](backupCisco.sh) - This script was made to do a quick dump of Cisco config on an ASA

* [bashcolors.sh](bashcolors.sh) - Simple color testing script

* [checklan](checklan) - Had issues where sometimes a CentOS machine would loose network connectivity if it wasnt actively used, not sure the cause but restarting the network fixed it.

* [colortest.sh](colortest.sh) - Another simple color testing script

* [conf&mysqlBkup.sh](conf&mysqlBkup.sh) - Script to back up config files and mysql databases

* [disableuser.sh](disableuser.sh) - Simple script to disable linux users

* [downloadsite.sh](downloadsite.sh) - script that will download an entire html site

* [epocconv.sh](epocconv.sh) - script to see the date from the epoc date

* [forward.sh](forward.sh) - script to forward parts, originaly made to share a vpn (as it was only allowed 2 users) so more users could access the servers on the other side of the network but I have found it works nice for lxc (linux containers) to forward for websservices.

* [ip_check](ip_check) - 

* [ldapfunctions](ldapfunctions) - functions for some simple ldap commands, a co-worker wrote them and I removed all of the important bits from it but its nice for reference

* [linuxdate.sh](linuxdate.sh) - How many days since Jan 1, 1970

* [localbkup.sh](localbkup.sh) - 

* [lsix](lsix) - This only works for certain terminals (I know xterm works) - this allows for images to be displayed in the command line. I believe I made an alias as well as I had to do something to make it work
