# Scripts

These are some html, css or js and bash files I either wrote or edited to suit my needs better than the original had.

* [backgroundchanger](backgroundchanger) - This was written as I couldnt get gnome or kde to properly change my background as I had too many files in the folder I was using (somewhere near 3000 images) and I wanted to randomize it regularly
