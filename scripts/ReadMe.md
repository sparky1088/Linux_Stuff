# Scripts

These are some html, css or js and bash files I either wrote or edited to suit my needs better than the original had.

* [ConnectvsDisconnects.py](ConnectvsDisconnects.py) - This is a simple python scripts that shows the number of connections and disconnections for Cisco ASA devices.

* [backgroundchanger.sh](backgroundchanger.sh) - This was written as I couldnt get gnome or kde to properly change my background as I had too many files in the folder I was using (somewhere near 3000 images) and I wanted to randomize it regularly
